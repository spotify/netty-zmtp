# Netty-zmtp

**Note** This project has been discontinued. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/netty-zmtp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/netty-zmtp)

This is a ZeroMQ codec for Netty that aims to implement ZMTP, the ZeroMQ
Message Transport Protocol versions 1.0 and 2.0 as specified in
http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:13 and http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:15.

This project is hosted on https://github.com/spotify/netty-zmtp/

At Spotify we use ZeroMQ for a lot of the internal communication between
services in the backend. As we implement more services on top of the JVM we
felt the need for more control over the state of TCP connections, routing,
message queue management, etc as well as getting better performance than seems
to be currently possible with the JNI based JZMQ library.

This project implements the ZMTP wire protocol but not the ZeroMQ API, meaning
that it can be used to communicate with other peers using e.g. ZeroMQ (libzmq)
but it's not a drop-in replacement for JZMQ like e.g. JeroMQ attempts to be.
For an example of how a ZeroMQ socket equivalent might be implemented using
the netty-zmtp codecs, see the `ZMTPSocket` class in the tests.

We have successfully used these handlers to implement services capable of
processing millions of messages per second.

Currently this project targets Java 7+ and Netty 4.1.x. It does not have any
native dependency on e.g. libzmq.

## Usage

To use netty-zmtp, insert a `ZMTPCodec` instance into your channel pipeline.

```java
ch.pipeline().addLast(ZMTPCodec.of(ROUTER));
```

Upstream handlers will receive `ZMTPMessage` instances.

```java
@Override
public void channelRead(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object msg) throws Exception {
 final ZMTPMessage message = (ZMTPMessage) msg;
 // ...
}
```

Wait for the ZMTP handshake to complete before sending messages.

```java
@Override
public void userEventTriggered(final ChannelHandlerContext ctx, final Object evt)
    throws Exception {
  if (evt instanceof ZMTPHandshakeSuccess) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

```

## Performance

Performance seems decent, with the throughput benchmark producing 7M+ messages/s throughput numbers
on a recent laptop.

For maximum throughput, look into using the `BatchFlusher` to opportunistically gather writes into
fewer syscalls.

Truly overhead conscientious users might want to look into implementing the `ZMTPEncoder` and
`ZMTPDecoder` interfaces for eliminating the `ZMTPMessage` intermediary when reading/writing
application messages.

## Benchmarks

### Preparation

First compile and run tests:

```
mvn clean test
```

Fetch dependencies:

```
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
```

Now benchmarks are ready to run.
